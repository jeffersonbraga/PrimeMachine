			This Instagram channel has already been authorized for analytics and streams.
			<br>Now, the content authorization is needed. 
		</div>

		<span>
			Please, insert your Instagram's login and password for content authorization.
			<br>In some cases it will be necessary to validate this process on your mobile device, 
				connected to the Instagram account you are trying to authorize. 
				For safety, Instagram may require that some channels repeat this process up to three times 
				(let's hope it works on the first try!). We are aware that this might be a little 
				unpleasant, but it is truly indispensable. 
			<br>Are you facing any difficulties in this process? Please, get in touch:
